## ?? What Was Removed (Not Actually Implemented)

- ? Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) - TODO comment says "when available"
- ? Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol - Documented but not implemented
- ? Model Context Protocol (MCP) - Not found in codebase
- ? Gemini CLI - Not found in codebase
- ? Cloud Storage - Mentioned but not used
- ? LaTeX - Not found
- ? Bun - Mentioned but not actually used
- ? Docker - Changed to Podman (actual tool used)

---

## ?? What Was Added (Actually Implemented)
